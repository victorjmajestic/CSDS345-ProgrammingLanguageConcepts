# CSDS345-ProgrammingLanguageConcepts

This repository contains all projects done for CSDS345 - Programming Language Concepts.

All projects involve the creation of a programming language interpreter using Racket/Scheme, and each project builds upon the previous. The interpreter works for a Java-like language, and specific tests can be found within each individual project folder.

Project 1 implements simple variable declaration, assignment, if/while functionality, and return statements. Created February 2023.

Project 2 implements break, continue, throw, and curly brackets {}. Created March 2023.

Project 3 implements functions, nested functions, function calls, and recursion. Created April 2023.

Project 4 implements object oriented programming mechanics--classes, extensions, static variables/functions, constructors, dot calls, etc. Created May 2023.

These projects were all created with the help of project teammates Matthew Vatne and Carter Chen.
